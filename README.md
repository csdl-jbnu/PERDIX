# PERDIX-OPEN
Welcome to the PERDIX project! PERDIX is an open-source Fortran library, which allows scientists to build and solve the sequence design of complex DNA nanostructures.

**PERDIX:**
* **P**urine (Adenine & Guanine) / Pyrimidine (Cytosine & Thymine)
* **E**ngineered
* **R**ecombinant
* **D**esign
* **I**nverse
* **X** = as the universal unknown variable for which the software will find the 'solution' as staple sequences

**Software variants:**
* **[PERDIX-6HB](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-6HB)**: Six helix bundle edge
* **[PERDIX-OPEN](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-OPEN)**: 2D/3D Open surfaced geometry 
* **[PERDIX-VEBELED](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-BEVELED)**: Beveled vertex design
* **[PERDIX-X](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-X)**: Arbitrary cross-section

# Setup
```git clone https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-OPEN.git```

# Features
* Fully automatic procedure for the sequence design of complex DNA nanostructures
* User-friendly TUI (Text-based User Interface)
* 3D visualization powered by [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/)
* Free and open source (GNU General Public License, version 2.0)
