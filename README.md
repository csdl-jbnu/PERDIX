<br>
**PERDIX:**
* **P**urine (Adenine & Guanine) / Pyrimidine (Cytosine & Thymine)
* **E**ngineered
* **R**ecombinant
* **D**esign
* **I**nverse
* **X** = as the universal unknown variable for which the software will find the 'solution' as staple sequences
<br>
**Software variants:**
* **[PERDIX-6P](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-6P)**: Design for 3D DNA 6HB-based wireframe nanoparticle
* **[PERDIX-2P](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-2P)**: Design for 3D DNA DX-based wireframe nanoparticles 
* **[PERDIX-6L](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-6L)**: Design for 2D DNA 6HB-based wireframe lattices
* **[PERDIX-2L](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-2L)**: Design for 2D DNA DX-based wireframe lattices
<br>
**Requirements:**
* Python 2.7 - [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/)
* MATLAB - [DistMesh](http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/)
<br>
## Setup
```git clone https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-2P.git```

The software document can be downloaded [here](./release/Doc/Software%20Document.pdf).
The atomic model(PDB) can be generated by cndo file using [MATLAB scripts](./release/Doc/Software%20Document.pdf) written by Keyao.
<br>
## Features
* Fully automatic procedure for the scaffold routing and sequence design
* Importing GEO, IGES/IGS(for PERDIX-2L/6L), or PLY file formats as an input
* Arbitrary edge-lengths to design asymmetric and irregular shapes
* JSON output for editing staples from [caDNAno](http://https://cadnano.org/)
* 3D visualization powered by [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/)
* Pre-defined target geometries
* User-friendly TUI (Text-based User Interface)
* Execuatable file on Windows and Mac
* Free and open source ([GNU General Public License, version 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html/))
