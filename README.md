## PERDIX-2L</br>

> Welcome to the PERDIX project! PERDIX is an open-source software written by FORTRAN 90/95, which allows scientists to build and solve the sequence design of complex DNA DX-based wireframe lattices.</br>

**Software Variants:**</br>
* **[PERDIX-6P](https://github.com/lcbb/PERDIX-6P)**: Designer scaffolded DNA 6HB-based wireframe nanoparticles</br>
* **[PERDIX-2L](https://github.com/lcbb/PERDIX-2L)**: Designer scaffolded DNA DX-based wireframe lattices</br></br>

## Free Online Resource PERDIX</br>
[```http://perdix-dna-origami.org/```](http://perdix-dna-origami.org/)</br>

We also offer the free online resource PERDIX that automatically converts any 2D object specified using a simple Computer-Aided Design file (GEO, IGS/IGES, or PLY) into the synthetic DNA sequences that are needed to synthesize the target object. With the same inputs, the outputs from online resource are exactly the same to those from the compiled PERDIX-2L.</br></br>

----------

The *.csv file generated by PERDIX-2L contains final staple sequences.</br>
The *.bild and *.json generated by PERDIX-2L can be opened by [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) and [caDNAno](https://cadnano.org/).</br>
The atomic model ([PDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format))) can be generated by *.cndo file using the [atomic model generator](https://cando-dna-origami.org/atomic-model-generator/) written by Dr. Keyao Pan.</br></br>

## Compiling Instructions</br>
```git clone https://github.com/lcbb/PERDIX-2L.git```</br>

**Requirements:**</br>
1. [Intel Fortran compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers): Intel Parallel Studio XE 2016, 2017 or 2018</br>
2. [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com): MATLAB 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 or 2018</br>
3. [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/): Not compatible with Python 3</br>
4. [Shapely 1.6.4](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/): Python package, Shapely is used to convert a set of lines to polygon meshes</br>
5. [DistMesh](http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/) or [PyDistMesh 1.2](https://pypi.org/project/PyDistMesh/): DistMesh (MATLAB version) or PyDistMesh (Python version) is used to generate internal triangular meshes</br>

- Compiling the PERDIX sources require [Intel Fortran](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers). Free Intel (R) Software Development Tools are available for qualified students, educators, academic researchers and open source contributors, see the [details](https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software/).</br>
- The Intel Fortran compiler supports all of the features of the Fortran 90, Fortran 95, Fortran 2003 standards and most of Fortran 2008. It also supports some draft Fortran 2018 features.
- We provide [MakeFile](./make/makefiles/Makefile) which is a simple way to organize code compilation of PERDIX.</br></br>
