# PERDIX-OPEN
Welcome to the PERDIX project! PERDIX is an open-source Fortran library, which allows scientists to build and solve the sequence design.

**PERDIX:**

- **P**urine (Adenine & Guanine) / Pyrimidine (Cytosine & Thymine)
- **E**ngineered
- **R**ecombinant
- **D**esign
- **I**nverse
- **X** = as the universal unknown variable for which the software will find the 'solution' as staple sequences

**4 software variants:**

1. **PERDIX-6HB**: Six helix bundle
2. **PERDIX-OPEN**: Open geometry
3. **PERDIX-CROSS**: Arbitrary cross-section
4. **PERDIX-Vebeled**: Beveled vertex

# Setup
