**PERDIX:**</br>
* **P**urine (Adenine & Guanine) / Pyrimidine (Cytosine & Thymine)</br>
* **E**ngineered</br>
* **R**ecombinant</br>
* **D**esign</br>
* **I**nverse</br>
* **X** = as the universal unknown variable for which the software will find the 'solution' as staple sequences</br>

**Software variants:**</br>
* **[PERDIX-6P](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-6P)**: Design for 3D DNA 6HB-based wireframe nanoparticle</br>
* **[PERDIX-2P](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-2P)**: Design for 3D DNA DX-based wireframe nanoparticles</br>
* **[PERDIX-6L](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-6L)**: Design for 2D DNA 6HB-based wireframe lattices</br>
* **[PERDIX-2L](https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-2L)**: Design for 2D DNA DX-based wireframe lattices</br>

**Requirements:**</br>
* Python 2.7 - [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/)</br>
* MATLAB - [DistMesh](http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/)</br>

## Setup</br>
```git clone https://github.com/hmjeon/PERDIX-2P.git```</br>

The software document can be downloaded [here](./release/Doc/Software%20Document.pdf).</br>
The atomic model(PDB) can be generated by cndo file using [MATLAB scripts](./release/Doc/Software%20Document.pdf) written by Keyao.</br>

## Features</br>
* Fully automatic procedure for the scaffold routing and sequence design</br>
* Importing GEO, IGES/IGS(for PERDIX-2L/6L), or PLY file formats as an input</br>
* Arbitrary edge-lengths to design asymmetric and irregular shapes</br>
* JSON output for editing staples from [caDNAno](http://https://cadnano.org/)</br>
* 3D visualization powered by [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/)</br>
* Pre-defined target geometries</br>
* User-friendly TUI (Text-based User Interface)</br>
* Execuatable file on Windows and Mac</br>
* Free and open source ([GNU General Public License, version 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html/))</br>
